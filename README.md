# Rails Dropdead

A rails version of the dice game Drop Dead

The game does not work as when clicking the play new game button it takes me to the sign up page despite the routing being done correctly, however the sign in and sign up pages are implemented and the user profile page is also implemented, along with redirecting to the game history page, and exiting. 

In order to view the site, go to http://cis3260.socs.uoguelph.ca:35045/login

Hello World is also implemented, you will just need to uncomment that line from the routes.rb file in config folder.
